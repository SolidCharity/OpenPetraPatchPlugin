Plugin Patch
==============

The Plugin patch allows us to build special functionality for some offices, without having to make something that works for everyone.
Other offices can take an existing plugin and modify it for their needs.

This patch is based on the Remoting patch (https://github.com/SolidCharity/OpenPetraPatchRemoting), ie you first have to apply the Remoting patch to OpenPetra trunk, before you can apply this Plugin patch.

This repository contains the patches needed, and will be updated irregularly to match recent versions of OpenPetra trunk.

For documentation how to create, maintain, and apply this patch, please see https://github.com/SolidCharity/OpenPetraPatchRemoting/blob/master/Readme.md
